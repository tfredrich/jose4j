The jose.4.j library is a robust and easy to use open source implementation of JSON Web Token (JWT) and the JOSE specification suite (JWS, JWE, and JWK).
It is written in Java and relies solely on the JCA APIs for cryptography.

This is a fork of Brian Campbell's library hosted on BitBucket.
Please see https://bitbucket.org/b_c/jose4j/wiki/Home for more info, examples, etc..
The implementation here has some enhancements specifically for SaaS usage
of the library, especially for externalized caching of JWKS and such.
